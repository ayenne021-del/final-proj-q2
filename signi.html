    <h2>A Pathway</h2>
    <p>
      Career planning is a vital process that helps students gain a deeper understanding of their interests, 
      skills, and long-term goals. By engaging in career planning at an early age, young individuals can establish 
      a clearer sense of direction and avoid confusion when faced with important academic and life decisions. 
      It encourages them to reflect on what truly motivates them, what they excel at, and what type of environment 
      they want to grow in. Through consistent self-assessment and exploration, career planning becomes a pathway 
      that guides the youth toward a more intentional and fulfilling future.

    <h2>What it Provides</h2>
    <p>
      Another significant contribution of career planning is its ability to guide students in making wise and 
      informed choices. Without proper guidance, many students may select courses or careers based on pressure, 
      trends, or assumptions rather than their actual interests or capabilities. Career planning provides clarity 
      and structure, helping them understand the requirements of various professions, the educational paths involved, 
      and the opportunities they can pursue to enhance their readiness. Equipped with this knowledge, students can 
      make decisions with confidence and purpose, reducing the likelihood of regret or misalignment later in life.

    <h2>Role of Planning</h2>
    <p>
      Career planning also plays a major role in raising awareness among the youth about the importance of preparing 
      for their future. Today’s rapidly changing world demands adaptability, critical thinking, and long-term vision. 
      Without proper planning, young people may struggle to keep up with the demands of modern careers and global 
      challenges. By understanding the value of career preparation, students become more proactive, responsible, and 
      motivated to take charge of their personal development. This awareness empowers them to see beyond short-term 
      academic tasks and recognize how their present efforts contribute to their future goals.
