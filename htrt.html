            <p>
                SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all. Career planning 
                supports this goal by giving learners the tools to understand themselves, explore 
                opportunities, and make informed decisions about their futures. When young people know 
                their options and have guidance, education becomes more meaningful, equitable, and 
                connected to real-world success.
            </p>

        <div class="sdg-row reverse">
            <p>
                By teaching career readiness, schools reduce inequality, empower students to set 
                achievable goals, and promote lifelong learning—major pillars of SDG 4. This program 
                encourages learners to recognize their potential and pursue education pathways that align 
                with their dreams.
